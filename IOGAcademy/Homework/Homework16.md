# SECTION'S FINAL PROJECT

Congratulations!! ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ you finished the "GAINING INDEPENDENCE" section of the course. ðŸ”¥ That means you should be able to build a simple project from start to finish by yourself. So, that's what you're going to do for this homework! ðŸ˜ƒ

Create and configure a new project using Cabal, and build a Tic-Tac-Toe game that follows these requirements:

## Requirements:

- It has to be a CLI executable with the business logic implemented as a library.
- There has to be a single-player (against the machine) and a multiplayer (two-player) mode.
- The machine has to play randomly.
- The board has to be printed nicely on the console.
- Use any library you want. However, the provided solution will only use the `random` library and Haskell features explained up until now. So, if you're tempted to use more advanced features, you're likely overcomplicating it.
